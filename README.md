This project contains my work and notes from the Coursera basic Python course. The main file in this project is a Jupyter notebook:

- **coursera_basictwo.ipynb**: Contains Python code, exercises, and explanations based on the course content I have covered so far.

## How to Clone This Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

## How to Use

1. (Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
2. Open the `coursera_basictwo.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run the cells to see code examples and outputs.
4. Review the explanations and notes for learning reference.

## Environment

- The project uses a Python virtual environment (`django_project`).
- All code and dependencies are managed within this environment.

## Status

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated as I cover more topics in the course.
